A simple script to select a random Legendary Hunter, since Crytek won't add it to the game proper.

Pulls the hunter list from a .txt file. You can easily modify the file as needed to add/subtract hunters you own.

Future versions of this (should there be any) would hopefully be fancier, with a tkinter interface with buttons to click...but God only knows if that will happen.

Created a barebones. There is also some code in "hunter_data" that is the foundation for fancier things, like keeping track of the hunters you own.
